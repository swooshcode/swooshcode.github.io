A month ago, I reached out to Tseng Shihida, from Tritone Imagery & Animation, proposing a potentially exciting collaboration between our companies in the realm of Virtual Reality. I have been enthusiastic about the prospect of working together to revolutionize the VR gaming industry, given our successful history of delivering results plus their proven track record in virtual reality and architectural rendering.

To recap, our proposition is to create an immersive Formosan(Taiwanese)-flavored Virtual Reality game, an experience that simulates a dynamic, engaging and interactive environment for its users. This project aims to blend real-world business concepts with gaming mechanisms, including the idea of a virtual economy that promotes player engagement and real commerce growth within the game.

I also envision a collaborative opportunity to build this project together with Huang Heshan, digital artist, and founder of plastic punk aesthetics in China. His masterpieces include ‚ÄúWild Design,‚Äù ‚ÄúFake IKEA,‚Äù and ‚ÄúToo Rich City.‚Äù

At Frame Tech Solutions, we value partnerships that foster creativity, innovation, and synergy, and we see a potential partnership with Tritone Imagery & Animation and Huang Heshan as one that could redefine the VR gaming landscape.

If you are reading this, or if you would like to support this project, I would be more than happy to arrange a meeting to further discuss our ideas and how we could bring this project to life. You're welcome to learn more about our company here: https://www.frametechtw.com

  <p> üçØ I'm a Lead Software Developer with a passion for coding and solving complex challenges. I have experience in the software development industry, and I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including UX/UI design, XCode, TESTFLIGHT, web development, web funnels, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js, React, Redux, Angular, Bootstrap, MongoDB, AWS, Azure, Git, Linux, Agile, Scrum, REST API, Machine Learning, Data Structures & Algorithms, Web Services, Cloud Computing, Design Patterns, Testing & Debugging, Networking, Security, DevOps, and Ruby on Rails.
At my previous role as Lead Software Developer at ChitChat, I was responsible for leading a team of developers in the development of a new software product. I was also responsible for the overall design and architecture of the product. I have a proven track record of success in delivering high-quality software products on time and within budget.
Here you will find direct links to my GitHub repositories and a collection of my written pieces including articles and blog posts about software development.
At the moment, I am engrossed in a number of open-source projects, which include:
    
1. Langchain-nla-util (In progress): This is an extensive project aiming to simplify complex natural language understanding operations. It's currently under development and you can follow its progress here: https://lnkd.in/gyd_UJTz .

2. ChitChatApp (Completed; currently developing a new version): This project resulted in an intuitive chat application that streamlines communication. We are now working on a newer version for an enhanced user experience. Find it here: https://lnkd.in/g2uFqXM7 .

3. DocuAssist (Completed): An automated document assistance tool, it aids in creating, editing, and sharing documents effectively. You can find the project here: https://lnkd.in/gMZzbqvB .

4. Auto-GPT-Plugins (In progress): This is an effort towards creating plugins to automate a variety of tasks, enhancing productivity. This plugin I have been honored to work on will automate speech with Google's Text-To-Speech API. The closed pull request can be found here: https://lnkd.in/gpzSThzY

It is still a work in progress and will be reopened soon to merge with this codebase: https://lnkd.in/gzQ6MnwX

Additionally, I'm also pouring my creativity into a few personal projects to be released a bit later. I'm always open to intriguing ideas and love to challenge myself with new projects. So, if you have any in mind, feel free to drop a message!

Thank you for taking out time to read this! Stay tuned for more updates.

I'm excited to network with other developers and learn more about the latest technologies. I'm also eager to take on new challenges and contribute to the development of innovative software products.
