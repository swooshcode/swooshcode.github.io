Dear Parents,

I hope this note finds you well! We have been busy learning and having fun in the classroom. This week, we reinforced the theme patterns - "What does (person) do?", "What is (person's) job?", and "What is (person) doing?". The students showed great understanding of these patterns and were able to use them correctly.

In addition, we also tested the students' understanding of sight words, numbers, and the alphabet. They did a fantastic job recognizing and identifying these important concepts. We also challenged their critical thinking skills with some fun and engaging activities.

One activity that really got the students thinking was a game where they had to match objects with the letters they started with. It was so much fun watching them think creatively and use their problem-solving skills!

Overall, it has been another great week in our kindergarten class. I am so proud of all the hard work and progress our students are making. Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to another fun and exciting week ahead!

Best regards,
Nigel.

Hey there, cool parents! This week in class, we've been exploring the wild world of professions! We've covered a bunch of exciting occupations like a Vetinarian (not a typo, we're just being fancy), Astronaut, Engineer, Athlete, Pilot, Dancer, and Musician. But don't let the fun stop there! Here are some ideas to keep the career train rolling at home: 

- Time to play dress-up! Encourage your child to unleash their inner professional by providing them with costumes and props.
- Crack open some books about different jobs! We recommend "Oh, the Places You'll Go!" by Dr. Seuss or "Career Day" by Anne Rockwell. 
- Check out educational videos that showcase different professions. Who knows, maybe your kid will be inspired to become a professional finger-painter or a unicorn trainer!
- See if there are any career fairs or events in your area that you can attend. 
- And if all else fails, have a family career day where everyone can dress up as their favorite professional and talk about what they do. Just don't be surprised if your little one declares they want to be a professional ice cream taster when they grow up. 

Thanks for being awesome parents, and keep on rocking! 

Best, 
Teacher Nigel.
